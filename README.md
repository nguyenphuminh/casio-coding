## Casio Coding

This repo contains documents related to programming on scientific calculators, specifically the Casio fx-580 VN X model and other models/brands alike. Note that this method of programming does not use overflow manipulation, it only uses normal behaviors of functions already built into the machine and maths, which are much less useful and more limited, but hey it is still fun and might be easier to understand for non-tech guys :)

If what you are looking for is Casio exploits to get its full power, here are some nice sources that I have checked out:
